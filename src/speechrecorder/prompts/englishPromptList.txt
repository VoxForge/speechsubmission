rp-01 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air,
rp-02 they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
rp-03 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
rp-04 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above,
rp-05 and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
rp-06 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
rp-07 People look, but no one ever finds it.
rp-08 When a man looks for something beyond his reach,
rp-09 his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
rp-10 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
rp-11 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
rp-12 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
rp-13 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign
rp-14 from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
rp-15 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge
rp-16 over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
rp-17 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
rp-18 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by
rp-19 reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
rp-20 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection,
rp-21 but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
rp-22 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
rp-23 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops,
rp-24 and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
rp-25 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of
rp-26 super-imposition of a number of bows.
rp-27 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first,
rp-28 the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band,
rp-29 since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
rp-30 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow,
rp-31 with little or no green or blue.
ar-01 Once there was a young rat named Arthur who never could make up his mind.
ar-02 Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them,
ar-03 he would only answer, "I don't know;" he wouldn't say yes or no either.
ar-04 He would always shirk making a choice. His Aunt Helen said to him,
ar-05 "Now look here! No one is going to care for you if you carry on like this."
ar-06 You have no more mind than a blade of grass.
ar-07 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft.
ar-08 The pine rafters were all rotten, so that the barn was rather unsafe.
ar-09 At last the joists gave way and fell to the ground.
ar-10 The walls shook, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
ar-11 "This won't do," said the captain; "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home."
ar-12 Within five hours the ten scouts came back and said,
ar-13 We found a stone house where there is room for us all.
ar-14 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree.
ar-15 The rats crawled out of their little houses and stood on the floor in a long line.
ar-16 Just then the old rat saw Arthur. Stop. he ordered coarsely.
ar-17 "You are coming, of course." "I'm not certain," said Arthur, undaunted,
ar-18 "The roof may not come down yet."
ar-19 "Well," said the old rat, "we can't wait for you to join us. Right about face! March!"
ar-20 Arthur stood and watched them hurry away.
ar-21 "I think I'll go tomorrow," he said calmly to himself, "but then again I don't know;"
ar-22 "it's so nice and snug here,".  That night there was a big crash.
ar-23 In the foggy morning some men with some boys and girls rode up and looked at the barn.
ar-24 One of them moved a board and saw a rat quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
